# Instagram BOT with Selenium on PYTHON (Without any API)

This project is currently unfinished.

Instagram used to let people use its' API. But in a few weeks, it will shut down the API support and no one will ever be able to use it anymore. 

In my code, you don't need any API so you don't have to worry about Instagram API.
Also this method is BAN-FREE if you don't change the sleep or click variables.
Not a fast way to use but at least it's steady, huh!
